Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/tableflip/nodebot-workshop?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n**A [nodeschool][1] workshop on how to get your Arduino alive with [rwaldron/johnny-five][2]**\n\n```shell\n# Install\nnpm install -g nodebot-workshop\n# Run\nnodebot-workshop\n```\n\n![Nodebot workshop menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop/master/screenshot.png)\n\nLearn the basics of the [johnny-five][2] api, as a series of code challenges.\n\n[johnny-five][2] is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.\n\n**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**\n\nThe workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.\n\nThe low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.\n\n**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**\n\nEach of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.\n\nWire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see your solution run for real.\n\n## Code style\n\nTo move towards a consistent style for nodeschool projects we use the .jshintrc\nas defined in learnyounode: https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode/blob/master/.jshintrc\n\nYour favourite jshint runner will work but a gulpfile is provided for hipsters.\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g gulp\ngulp\n```\n\n...to run it.\n\n## Thanks\n\n- @rvagg - and the [nodeschool.io][1] team. This workshopper is based on the new 1.0 release of [rvagg/learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode).
