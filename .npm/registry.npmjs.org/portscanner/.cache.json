node-portscanner\n\nThe portscanner module is\nan asynchronous JavaScript port scanner for Node.js.\n\nPortscanner can check a port,\nor range of ports,\nfor 'open' or 'closed' statuses.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install portscanner\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nA brief example:\n\n```javascript\nvar portscanner = require('portscanner')\n\n// Checks the status of a single port\nportscanner.checkPortStatus(3000, '127.0.0.1', function(error, status) {\n  // Status is 'open' if currently in use or 'closed' if available\n  console.log(status)\n})\n\n// Find the first available port. Asynchronously checks, so first port\n// determined as available is returned.\nportscanner.findAPortNotInUse(3000, 3010, '127.0.0.1', function(error, port) {\n  console.log('AVAILABLE PORT AT: ' + port)\n})\n\n// Find the first port in use or blocked. Asynchronously checks, so first port\n// to respond is returned.\nportscanner.findAPortInUse(3000, 3010, '127.0.0.1', function(error, port) {\n  console.log('PORT IN USE AT: ' + port)\n})\n```\n\nThe example directory contains a more detailed example.\n\n## Test\n\nThere are currently no tests.\nIf you have ideas,\nplease open an issue.\n\n## Future\n\nPlease create issues or pull requests\nfor port scanning related features\nyou'd like to see included.\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/baalexander/node-portscanner","keywords":["portscanner","port","scanner","checker","status"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/baalexander/node-portscanner/issues"},"users":{"zhangyaochun":true,"mr1024":true,"matteo.collina":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"CFGS1BX143AZ51A4AJSLTR2L9\""}
